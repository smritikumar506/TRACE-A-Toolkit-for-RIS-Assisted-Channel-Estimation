# TRACE-A-Toolkit-for-RIS-Assisted-Channel-Estimation
TRACE is a toolkit for channel estimation in RIS assisted wireless systems, where the ideal RIS response and wireless channel are modeled. Toolkit includes an end-to-end generic transceiver and 2 phase CE process. An initial training phase estimates the cascaded channel, followed by data transmission with fixed optimal RIS settings.
